# ***Chain Reaction***

Frank has completed his program for the game Chain Reaction! While testing his program, Frank discoveres that there are issues regarding some of the words that are used to build the word chains. Your goal is to remove words from the ArrayList to ensure the program runs at 100% efficiency.

The program already extracts the words from "wordList.txt" into a 2D ArrayList, or an ArrayList of ArrayList. You will need to remove invalid words from the ArrayList by creating the method body for the cleanData method. An invalid word will fit at least one of the following criteria:
    • The word never appears as the first word in a row of words.
    • A row of words only has 1 valid word.
    • If one instance of a word is removed all instances of that word must be removed.

Once you have removed all invalid words, the final word counts will be:
    • Number of total words = 8033
    • Number of unique words = 2334
